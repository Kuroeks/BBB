# Bib's Bizarre Bazaar (WIP)

**Bib's Bizarre Bazaar** is a **work-in-progress mod** for *Balatro* that introduces:

- Custom **suits** and **ranks** based on traditional *Scopa* cards  
- A brand new **Scopa Deck**  
- ...and much more to come!

This mod is still under development, and future updates will expand the content even further.

### Special Thanks

This project wouldn't have been possible without the help and inspiration from other amazing mods and resources:

- The **Cryptid**, **Yahimod**, **Six Suits**, and **Ortalab** mods — for helping me understand how to implement various parts of the code  
- **nh6574** for their fantastic repository, **VanillaRemade**  
- The **SMODS Wiki** — an invaluable resource throughout development  
- And a huge thank you to the **Balatro Discord community** for their support, feedback, and encouragement
